1 - When calling isEmpty() it always returns true stating that the list is empty.
2 - RemoveFront() and removeBack() do not remove items. (this is caused by isEmpty()).
the reason that this fails. (when either these functions are called, it first called isEmpty() to verify that there is a list to check.
if it didn't there is a possible chance for bad memory output. Since isEmpty always calls the true neither of these functions preform their 
task and send back false stating that the list is empty.

3-(not sure if im dumb or it was a bug but) -- when attempting to call the destructor I get an error stating
pure virtual method called
terminate called without an active exception
(this will not be in my code as it killed my program)
